== Validated Pattern workflow
[#workflow]

Let's dive into what happens when we deploy a pattern! Take a look at the following graphic to see what is deployed on the `hub` clusterGroup cluster.

1. The patterns operator deploys an instance of {rh-gitops} and creates the initial application
2. ArgoCD then deploys the operators, namespaces, projects and applications defined in the values files
3. If deploying across multiple clusters, the framework uses {rhacm} policies to create the instance of {rh-gitops} on the remote cluster

INFO: `values-hub.yaml` is the primary values file for the `hub` cluster

IMPORTANT: Deploying the pattern through the OpenShift Console or via `pattern.sh` will deploy the patterns operator.

1. When a managed cluster is joined to {rhacm} it needs to have a clusterGroup label applied to it for the correct policies and applications to be deployed.
2. {rhacm} will confirm the cluster is managed then deploy a rhacm agent 
3. A placement policy is then deployed to the managed cluster which installs an instances of {rh-gitops}
4. The managed cluster's instance of ArgoCD will then deploy the resources declared in `values-clustergroup.yaml`

=== Element Layering 
[#layering]

The base component of every Validated Pattern is `common` - which is a link:https://github.com/validatedpatterns/common[Github Repo]

Without further configuration, common is acutally quite boring. So let's add another layer! 

Your specific industry or use-case is layered into the framework and utilizes the underlying common. In this example the solution includes a bespoke application, cloud-native cluster storage, {rhacs}, and an enterprise container registry. The framework will deploy and configure these components through Helm charts, kustomize manifests or Ansible if necessary.

What if we wanted to swap these products out with a similar or like-in-kind solution? The workflow remains the same:

- remove the undesired application declaration
- declare the new application in your values file
- declare where the helm charts reside (path, repo)

The following graphic illustrates swapping components in the framework:
