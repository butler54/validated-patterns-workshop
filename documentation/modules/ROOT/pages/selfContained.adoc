* What it means to be a "Self Contained" pattern

Every Pattern has resources that make it unique:

* Container Images
* Containerfiles (aka: Dockerfiles)
* Helm Charts
* Kustomize Manifests
* Kubernetes Manifests
* Ansible Codes
* Shell/Other programming language scripts

Where or would I add them to the pattern? 

|===
|**Resource Type**|**Placement**
| `kubernetes manifests (.yaml)`
| They can either be converted to a Helm chart, or the raw manifests can be placed in a directory under `charts/`
|`kustomize manifests`
| Kustomize manifests can be placed in a directory under `charts/` or another path (e.g. `kustomize`) could be used
|`Ansible`
| Ansible roles and playbooks can be deployed through the imperative framework, or via kubernetes job resources in a Helm chart
|'Scripts'
| Shell scripts and other programs that are required for applications can be converted to a configMap and mounted as a volume in a pod (job) 

|===


IMPORTANT: The pattern should be able to deploy all the resources needed to run your applications.

=== Thoughts on Self-Contained Patterns

* Reusability / Repurposing becomes a serious problem when these resources are behind paywalls, private github repositories and registries.

* Patterns designed and delivered for public consumption should have all of its resources available in a public repository and container registry

* Self-contained patterns is letting the cluster build and deploy the container image used by applications (where it makes sense).
