----

* Used to deploy the pattern from the command-line
* Deploys the operator with a repository and branch from the local clone of the repo
* Provides a way to invoke the container which has all of the pre-requisites software installed (e.g. python, ansible, make)
* Improved User Experience when deploying Patterns from the command line
* When installing a pattern use:

[source,bash]
----
./pattern.sh make install
----
* When loading secrets into your deployment
[source,bash]
----
./pattern.sh make load-secrets
----

IMPORTANT: pattern.sh uses your origin remote and current branch. To change the branch after a deployment, run `make install` in the new branch
