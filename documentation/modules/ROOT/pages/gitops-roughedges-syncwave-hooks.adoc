= Sync Waves and Hooks
include::_attributes.adoc[]

https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/sync-waves/[Sync waves,window='_blank']
are used in Argo CD to order how manifests are applied to the cluster. 

https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/resource_hooks/[Resource
hooks,window='_blank'] break up the delivery of these manifests into different
phases.

Using a combination of sync waves and resource hooks, you can control how your
application rolls out.

This example will take you through the following steps:

* Using sync waves to order deployment
* Exploring resource hooks
* Using sync waves and hooks together

The sample application that we will deploy is a TODO application with a database
and, apart from deployment files, sync waves and resource hooks are used:

== Using Sync Waves

A sync wave is a way to order how Argo CD applies the manifests that are stored
in git. All manifests have a wave of zero by default, but you can set these by
using the `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave` annotation. 

Example:

[.console-output]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "2"
----

The wave can also be negative as well.

[.console-output]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "-5"
----

When Argo CD starts a sync action, the manifests get placed in the following
order:

* The Phase that they're in (we'll cover phases in the next section)
* The wave the resource is annotated in (starting from the lowest value to the
  highest)
* By kind (Namespaces first, then services, then deployments, etc ...)
* By name (ascending order)

documentation site,window='_blank'].

[#exploring_the_manifests_waves]
=== Exploring Sync Wave Manifests

The sample application that you will deploy has several waves.

First, *PostgreSQL* with sync wave *0*. It has a Deployment:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::example$todo/postgres-deployment.yaml[]
----

The *PostgreSQL Service* with sync wave *0*:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::example$todo/postgres-service.yaml[]
----

Second, *Database table creation* with sync wave *1*:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::example$todo/postgres-create-table.yaml[]
----

The *TODO application deployment* with sync wave *2*:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::example$todo/todo-deployment.yaml[]
----

The *TODO Service* with sync wave *2*:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::example$todo/todo-service.yaml[]
----

The *TODO Route* with sync wave *3*:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::example$todo/todo-route.yaml[]
----

First, the PostgreSQL Deployment will be applied. After that reports healthy,
Argo CD will continue with the rest of resources.

> NOTE: Argo CD won't apply the next manifest in a wave until the previous
reports "healthy".

[#using_resource_hooks]
== Using Resource Hooks

Now that you're familiar with sync waves, we can begin exploring applying
manifests in phases using `resource hooks`.

Controlling your sync operation can be further refined by using
hooks. These hooks can run before, during, and after a sync
operation. These hooks are:

* **PreSync** - Runs before the sync operation. This can be something like a
  database backup before a schema change
* **Sync** - Runs after `PreSync` has successfully ran. This will run alongside
  your normal manifests.
* **PostSync** - Runs after `Sync` has ran successfully. This can be something
  like a Slack message or an email notification.
* **SyncFail** - Runs if the `Sync` operation has failed. This is also used to
  send notifications or do other evasive actions.

To enable a sync, annotate the specific object manifest with
`argocd.argoproj.io/hook` with the type of sync you want to use for that
resource. For example, if you wanted to use the `PreSync` hook:

[.console-output]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PreSync
----

You can also have the hooks be deleted after a successful/unsuccessful run.

* **HookSucceeded** - The resource will be deleted after it has succeeded.
* **HookFailed** - The resource will be deleted if it has failed.
* **BeforeHookCreation** - The resource will be deleted before a new one is
  created (when a new sync is triggered).

You can apply these with the `argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy`
annotation. For example:

[.console-output]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PostSync
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy: HookSucceeded
----

> IMPORTANT: Since a sync can fail in any phase, you can come to a situation where
the application never reports healthy!

Although hooks can be any resource, they are usually Pods and/or Jobs.

To read more about resource hooks, consult the
https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/resource_hooks[official
documentation]

[#exploring_the_manifests_hooks]
=== Exploring Resource Hook Manifests

Take a look at this `PostSync` manifest which sends an HTTP request to insert a
new TODO item:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::example$todo/todo-insert-data.yaml[]
----
<1> This means that this Job will run in the `PostSync` phase, after the
  application of the manifests in the `Sync` phase.

> IMPORTANT: Since there is no deletion policy, this job will "stick around"
after completion.

The execution order can be seen in the following diagram:

[#deploying_the_application]
== Deploying The Application

Taking a look at this manifest file: `todo-application.yaml`:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::example$todo-application.yaml[]
----

Create this application:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
sed 's/$USERNUM/%USERNUM%/' ~/openshift-gitops-workshop/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/todo-application.yaml | oc apply -n user%USERNUM%-argocd -f -
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
application.argoproj.io/todo-app created
----

On the Argo CD WebUI, you should see another application appear.

image::todo-card.png[TODO Card]

Clicking on this "card" should take you over to the tree view.

image::todo-argocd.png[TODO Tree]

Observe the sync process. You will see the order that the resource has been applied, first the namespace creation and last the creation of Route to access the application.

Once the application is fully synced. Take a look at the pods and jobs in
the namespace:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get pods -n user%USERNUM%-todo
----

You should see that the Job is finished, but still there.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
NAME                           READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
postgresql-599467fd86-cgj9v    1/1     Running     0          32s
todo-gitops-679d88f6f4-v4djp   1/1     Running     0          19s
todo-table-xhddk               0/1     Completed   0          27s
----

You can get the Route for your application from the topology view, or you can
use the following CLI snippet to get the exact URL you need:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get route -n user%USERNUM%-todo todo -o jsonpath='{"http://"}{.spec.host}{"/todo.html\n"}'
----

> WARNING: You need to use `/todo.html` in the URL to access the application. It
does not automatically redirect.

Your application should look like this:

image::todo-app-screenshot.png[TODO]

The `todo-insert` Job is not shown as it was configured to be deleted if succeeded:

[source, yaml]
----
argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy: HookSucceeded
----
