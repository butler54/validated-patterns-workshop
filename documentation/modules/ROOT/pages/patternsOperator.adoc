=== Validated Operator Features

* Available as a community operator in Operator Hub
* Interrogates the cluster and uses information to personalize the pattern with argo/helm values
* Allows you to pick a repository for the pattern and to select a branch version (e.g. `stable`)
* Deploys OpenShift GitOps with the correct `values-hub`
* Regardless of how you deploy the pattern, the operator is still in use

IMPORTANT: `make load-secrets` is required when deploying the operator via OpenShift Console.
